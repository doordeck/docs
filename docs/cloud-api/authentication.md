# Authentication

Doordeck uses tokens to permit access to the API. Doordeck expects for the token to be included in all API requests to 
the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`

:::info
You must replace <code>TOKEN</code> with your authentication token.
:::

Authentication tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT) loosely using the OpenID format, they can be examined to determine their
expiry date, the user's ID. JSON web tokens are split into three sections separated by a `.`, the header, payload and
signature - each section can be BASE64URL decoded to read further.

Doordeck understands the following OpenID fields in the auth token payload:

Authentication tokens can be issued directly by Doordeck using the [login](./account/login-v2.md) endpoint or by third-party 
application developers using pre-registered asymmetric authentication keys.
