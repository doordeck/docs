# Introduction

Welcome to the Doordeck API! You can use our API to access Doordeck API endpoints, which can get information on the state of locks, manage access and perform operations.

This API documentation is generated using [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate), if you spot any errors please submit a pull request directly on [Github](https://github.com/doordeck/docs/).
