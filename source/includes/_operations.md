</aside>

This endpoint allows the retrieval of a user's public key along with their ID.
If user is not found, one is created for the specified USER_EMAIL.

```shell
curl 'https://api.doordeck.com/share/invite/USER_EMAIL' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' 
```
> - Replace `USER_EMAIL` with the user's email

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | -------- | -----------
visitor   | false    | Defaults to false, set to true to direct the visitor to a purely web based experience.

## Get A User’s Public Key

This endpoint allows retrieval of a user's public key, it provides additional flexibility to third-party application 
developers by allowing querying via email, telephone, user identifier (both internal and external) and by complete 
identity (encrypted).

Queries against this endpoint are filtered by the third-party's user pool, in other words, this call will only return 
users belonging to the same application as specified in the auth token.

This endpoint accepts a single JSON key (multiple keys cannot be used) which can be one of the following:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| email | Email address |
| telephone | E.164 formatted telephone |
| localKey | Doordeck identifier for a user (UUID) |
| foreignKey | Third-party application's identifier for a user |
| identity | Encrypted OpenID token of user |

The first four query keys, ```email```, ```telephone```, ```localKey``` and ```foreignKey``` are read only - these will 
return a 404 error if the user is not known to Doordeck. 

The remaining query key, ```identity```, is used to specify the full identity of the user who is the subject of the
query, this will mean the user is created if they don't exist and will always return a response. When using 
```identity```, the specified OpenID token must be encrypted so it cannot be abused as an authentication token - it 
should be encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE) using the RSA key Doordeck generates for the particular third-party
application.

```shell
curl 'https://api.doordeck.com/directory/query' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{"email":"USER_EMAIL"}'
```
> - Replace `USER_EMAIL` with the user's email

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "publicKey":"base 64 encoded public key"
}
```

### HTTP Request

This endpoint allows operations to be performed on a lock, such as lock, unlock, add/remove user. Requests to this endpoint must be signed and formed as a JSON Web Token (JWT).

### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.doordeck.com/device/LOCK_ID/execute`

Replace `LOCK_ID` with the appropriate lock ID.

<aside class="success">
If a request expires within the next 60 seconds, a 204 is returned upon success, if a request expires in more than 60 seconds, a 202 is returned to indicate the request has been queued for the device.
</aside>

### JWT Structure

The JWT header is formed of the following fields:

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
alg | true | `RS256` (legacy) RSA signed with a 256 bit SHA hash, or EdDSA for ephemeral key signatures
x5c | false | User's certificate chain, mandatory for EdDSA signatures
typ | true | `JWT`, JSON web token

The JWT body is formed of the following fields:

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
iss | true | Issuer, this should be the user's ID
sub | true | Subject, this should be the lock's ID
nbf | true | Not before, a Unix timestamp indicating the earliest date the request is valid from
iat | true | Issued at, the current Unix timestamp
exp | true | Expires, a Unix timestamp indicating when the request should expire, requests to change the lock status should be valid for up to one minute, other requests can have a much longer expiry time
jti | false (but highly recommended) | User generated, unique ID used for tracking the request status and preventing replay attacks. UUIDs are recommended here.
operation | true | A JSON object containing the instructions of the lock

The operation object definition is as follows

Parameter | Required | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
type | true | Must be `ADD_USER`
user | true | ID of user to add
publicKey | true | Public key of user to add
role | false | Should be either ADMIN or USER
start | false | Unix timestamp of when the user should be active from, null or unset to start immediately
end | false | Unix timestamp of when the user should expire, null or unset for never expires

After the request has been signed with user's private key, it should be sent to the execute endpoint.
